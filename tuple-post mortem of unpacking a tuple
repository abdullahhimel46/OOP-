# Main purpose: Assigning specific values and collect the remaining ones
# If the number of variables is less than the number of values in a collection, you 
can add an Asterisk(*z) to the variable name
# Asterisk(*) allows to assign a portion of the elements from a collection to
a specific variable
# It allows to handle variable-length collections (means in sutuations where the exact 
number of elements is unknown in a tuple, list, or other collections) or when you want
to separate a few known values from a collection.
# When (*) is useed in a variable assignment, it tells Python to collect multiple 
remaining values into a list.

# a = 1, b = 2, c = [3, 4, 5, 6]
